# PartiStep

A step sequencer that can sequence both melody and partials (overtones), which can create some quite nice polyrhythmic melodies among other things!

PartiStep also contains an interface to the Novation Launchpad so that it's easy(ish) to use.

## Usage

- connect launchpad if you have one.
- lein repl
- connect from eg. emacs
- compile src/partistep/stepsequencer.clj
- see (comment ...) exp in the top of that namespace :-)
