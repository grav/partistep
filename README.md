# Parti Step

A step sequencer that can sequence both melody and partials (overtones), which can create some quite nice polyrhythmic melodies among other things!

## Usage

- lein repl
- connect from emacs
- compile src/stepsequencer.clj
- see (comment ...) exp in bottom :-)

I'll be making a short video demo soon. Promise!
